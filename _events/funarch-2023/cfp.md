## Background

"Functional Software Architecture" refers to methods of construction
and structure of large and long-lived software projects that are
implemented in functional languages and released to real users,
typically in industry.

The goals for the workshop are:

- To assemble a community interested in software architecture
  techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;

- To identify, categorize, and document topics relevant to
  the field of functional software architecture;

- To connect the functional programming community to the software
  architecture community to cross-pollinate between the two.

The workshop follows on from the Functional Software Architecture
open space that was held at ICFP 2022 in Slovenia.

## Scope

The workshop seeks submissions in a range of categories:

- You're a member of the FP community and have thought about how
  to support programming in the large, for example by framing
  functional ideas in architectural terms or vice verse, comparing
  different languages in terms of their architectural capabilities,
  clarifying architectural roles played by formal methods, proof
  assistants and DSLs, or observing how functional concepts are
  used in other language and architecture communities.

  **Great, submit a research paper!**

- You're a member of the architecture community, and have thought
  about how your discipline might help functional programmers, for
  example by applying domain-driven design, implementing hexagonal
  architecture, or designing self-contained systems.

  **Excellent, submit a research paper!**

- You've worked on a large project using functional programming,
  and it's worked out well, or terribly, or a mix of both; bonus
  points for deriving architectural principles from your experience.

  **Wonderful, submit an experience report!**

- You know a neat architectural idiom or pattern that may be useful
  to others developing large functional software systems.

  **Fabulous, submit an architectural pearl!**

- You have something that doesn't fit the above categories, but
  that still relates to functional software architecture, such 
  as something that can be written up, or that could be part of
  the workshop format like a panel debate or a fishbowl.

  **Superb, submit to the open category!**

Research papers should explain their research contributions in both
general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished,
explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work,
and to other languages where appropriate.

Experience reports and architectural pearls need not necessarily
report original research results.  The key criterion for such papers
is that they make a contribution from which others can benefit.
It is not enough simply to describe a large software system, or
to present ideas that are specific to a particular system.

Open category submissions that are not intended for publication 
are not required to follow the formatting guidelines, and can 
submit in PDF, word or plain text format as preferred.

If you are unsure whether your contribution is suitable, or if
you need any kind of help with your submission, please email
the program chairs at <funarch2023@easychair.org>.

## Submission

Papers must be submitted by 1st June 2023 using the [EasyChair
submission page](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=funarch2023).

Formatting: submissions intended for publication must be
in PDF format and follow the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines,
using the acmart format and the sigplan
sub-format.  Please use the review option when submitting, as this
enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.  For further
details, see [SIGPLAN's author information](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format).

If your submission is not a research paper, please mark this using
a subtitle (Experience Report, Architectural Pearl, Open Category).

Length: submissions must adhere to the limits specified below.
However, there is no requirement or expectation that all pages
are used, and authors are encouraged to strive for brevity.

| **Research papers**	   | &nbsp;&nbsp; | 5 to 12+ pages |
| **Architectural pearls** | | 5 to 12 pages |
| **Experience reports**   | | 3 to 6 pages |
| **Open category**	   | | 1 to 6 pages |
|                          | | |

Publication: The proceedings of FUNARCH 2023 will be published in the ACM Digital
Library, and authors of accepted papers are required to agree to one
of the standard ACM licensing options.  Accepted papers must be
presented at the workshop by one of the authors, but in special cases
we may consider remote presentation.

The official publication date is the date the papers are made
available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two
weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official
publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings
related to published work.
