"Functional Software Architecture" refers to methods of construction
and structure of large and long-lived software projects that are
implemented in functional languages and released to real users,
typically in industry.

The goals for the workshop are:

- To assemble a community interested in software architecture
  techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;

- To identify, categorize, and document topics relevant to
  the field of functional software architecture;

- To connect the functional programming community to the software
  architecture community to cross-pollinate between the two.
    
FUNARCH 2023 will be co-colocated with [ICFP 2023](https://icfp23.sigplan.org/)
in Seattle on 8th September 2023.

The [Call for Papers](cfp/) is open - submission deadline 1st June 2023.
