This site is devoted to the use of functional programming for *large*
software projects: How to do it, how well it works, how it relates to
the software architecture outside of functional programming.

This site is currently mainly the home of the [FUNARCH Workshop
Series](/events/) co-located with the [International Conference on
Functional Programming](https://www.icfpconference.org/).
